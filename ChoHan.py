# Description: A Cho-Han game program where players bet on the outcome of two dice rollsâ€”cho (even) or han (odd). 
# Players place bets, choose their prediction, and win or lose based on the dice sum. The program handles player balance, 
# bet validation, dice rolling, and displays results for the single round simulated.
